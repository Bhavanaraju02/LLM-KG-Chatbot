##  Overview

KG-QA-Chatbot is designed to understand user queries, fetch data from DBpedia using SPARQL, and generate informative responses through an LLM. The chatbot supports a wide range of factual questions and is accessible via a Streamlit-based interface.

##  Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+
2. Git
3. pip


### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigmallya/LLM-KG-Chatbot.git
cd LLM-KG-Chatbot
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For Linux/Mac:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up API Key and Base URL

1. Navigate to the `.streamlit` directory.
2. Open or create the `secrets.toml` file.
3. Add the following configuration:

```toml
[API]
MODEL_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
MODEL_END_POINT = "YOUR_BASE_URL"
```

> Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_BASE_URL` with your actual credentials.

##  Run the Chatbot

Once setup is complete, run the chatbot using:

```bash
streamlit run src/main.py
```

Visit the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to start chatting!

##  Example Questions for Testing

Here are some example questions to test the chatbotâ€™s capabilities:

### Easy
- What is the currency of Japan?
- What is the capital city of Brazil?
- Who painted the Mona Lisa?
- Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?

### Moderate
- Where was Narendra Modi born? / Where was Albert Einstein born?
- How tall is the Eiffel Tower in meters?
- Who directed the movie "The Matrix"?
- What is the maximum depth of the Pacific Ocean in meters?
- How old was Albert Einstein when he died?

### Challenging
- How many official languages does Singapore have? / Switzerland?
- What is the route end of the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway?
- Where can one find Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche?
- Which car brand has manufactured the most models?
